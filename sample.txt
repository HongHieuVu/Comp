Wild Wild West
Wild Wild West, Jim West, desperado, rough rider
No you don't want nada
None of this, gun in this, brotha runnin this,
Buffalo soldier, look it's like I told ya
Any damsel that's in distress
Be out of that dress when she meet Jim West
Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step with flex and get a hole in your side
Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react,
You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at,
With all of this, from the start of this,
Runnin the game, James West tamin the west so remember the name
Now who ya gonna call?
Not the G.B.'s
Now who you gonna call?
If you have a riff with people wanna bust,
Break out before you get bumrushed at the (Wild Wild West)
When I roll into the (Wild Wild West)
When I stroll into the (Wild Wild West)
When I bounce into the (Wild Wild West) Sisqo, Sisqo
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
Now, now, now, now once upon a time in the west
Mad man lost his damn mind in the west
Loveless, givin up a dime, nothin' less
Now I must put his behind to the test (can you feel me)
Then through the shadows, in the saddle, ready for battle
Bring all your boys in, here come the poison
Behind my back, all the riffin' ya did,
Front and center, now where your lip at kid?
Who dat is? A mean brotha, bad for your health
Lookin damn good though, if I could say it myself
Told me Loveless is a mad man, but I don't fear that
Got mad weapons too, ain't tryin to hear that
Tryin to bring down me, this champion
When y'all clowns gon' see that it can't be done
Understand me son, I'm the slickest they is,
I'm the quickest as they is, did I say I'm the slickest they is
So if you barking up the wrong tree we comin, don't be startin nothin
Me and my partner gonna test your chest, Loveless
Can't stand the heat then get out the Wild Wild West
We going straight to (when I roll into the) the Wild Wild West (when I stroll into the)
We going straight to (when I bounce into the) the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
To any outlaw tryin to draw, thinkin you're bad,
Any draw on West best with a pen and a pad,
Don't even think about it, six gun, weighin a ton,
10 paces and turn, just for fun, son,
Up till sundown, rolling around,
See where the bad guys are to be found and make 'em lay down,
The defenders of the west,
Crushin on pretenders in the west,
Don't mess with us cuz we're in the (Wild Wild West)
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West, come on
When I roll into the

When I stroll into the
We going straight to the Wild Wild West (the Wild Wild West)

Counting Stars
OneRepublic
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
I see this life
Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my faces flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
The old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I, feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I, feel something so wrong
But doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
But baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is a four letter word
Make that money
Watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I, feel something so wrong
But doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
But baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Take that money and watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money and watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money and watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money and watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

If I Lose Myself
OneRepublic, Alesso
I stared up at the sun
Thought of all the people,
Places and things I've loved
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out of the window, tonight
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
If I lose myself tonight
Wooh, wooh, wooh!
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight
I woke up with the sun
Thought of all the people
Places and things I've loved
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out the window, tonight
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
If I lose myself tonight
Wooh, wooh, wooh!
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight
Wooh!
Lose myself tonight
Wooh, wooh, wooh, wooh
Wooh, wooh, wooh, wooh
